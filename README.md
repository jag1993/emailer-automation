# Hello Person
> Was bored so I made a test script that sends emails to a list of people

1. Open Terminal and CD into this directory
2. Type in npm install to install all dependencies
3. Type in node index.js
4. enjoy email

>PS, you have to input your own values in the mail list code because I'm lazy and will abstract this soon
> I would probably use process.argv and an NPM package so any user can log in and add people to their own mailing list
> Enjoy :)
